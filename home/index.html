				<h1><span>Hi! I'm James Cardinale.</span> I am a web developer.</h1>
				<p>I am always trying to push my abilities to the next level. Recently I stumbled across a blog by Jennifer Dewalt.
				She started a project called "180 website in 180 days." Her adventure began with no prior knowledge of web development. 
				Over a 180 day span she coded 180 separate web pages and apps varying from basic games to more complex web apps; slightly increasing the difficulty of every project with every new page.
				After completing this she was able to start up her own dynamnic website. 
				Jennifer is an inspiration and I wanted to challenge myself to re-create her project. 
				Out of respect and in an attept to remain an independant project, my goal is to re-create her projects only by using her page ideas. I don't want to copy her code. I won't learn anything if I did anyway!</p>
